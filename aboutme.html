    <p>I'm an IT technician who's transitioned into the developer world and am excited to enhance my perspective of internet standards and technologies.  Having worked in IP networking and system administration circles for years, I have tech rooted experience and enjoy the challenge of finding and fixing bugs.   That experience alone, how ever informative, hasn’t brought me the fulfillment I've been searching for.  Having friends spread across different STEM disciplines like machine learning and bioinformatics, I've glimpsed a lifestyle and pedagogy I've been aspiring to find this last decade.  This is why I’m so enthusiastic and grateful to be learning fundamental concepts and skillsets in Rithm School’s software engineering program.  With this program I hope to jumpstart my new career in software development and close in on my goal of becoming a software engineer.</p>

    <p>Outside of my tech interests I spend much of my time playing and listening to music.  I’ve played classical piano since early childhood and studied piano performance in school at one point.  And while I love classical music, I’m currently looking to tweak my approach to keyboard music by learning how to improvise and comp over jazz.  Seeking out new music for learning or just entertainment purposes has always been a passion of mine.  My other hobbies and interests include rock climbing, disc golf, and video games from time to time.  While climbing gives me a feeling of being physically and mentally challenging, disc golf meets both of those criteria but with the added benefit of bringing my dog, Drax!
